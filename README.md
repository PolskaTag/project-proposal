# Project Proposal: Django
## Philip Lapinski

## Django?
**Django** is a web framework using high level Python. It was built for making easy to build web applications and providing enormous built in functionality to the user.
In the past, developers making websites without frameworks had to implement common features from scratch. Even though they were practiced in making these features,
it still took up time and time is money. On top of that, many web features revolve around sensitive information that must be kept safe.
Django encapsulated decades of common practice into one fluid framework which offers developers a fast, safe, and scalable approach to future web projects.
Many companies today integrate Django into their codebase.

## Education:
This proposal links up to the individual project’s goals for many reasons. Django is a huge community, with about 2100 consistent contributors and over 600,000 git users.
That means that teamwork and communication is vital for the Django ship to stay afloat. Django also uses many modern day tools to stay organized
such as git, docs, diagrams, testing and much more.

## Contribution:
My main goal for contributing is to read through the existing codebase and verify tests or reported bugs. Getting started in the Django community
entails a gigantic codebase and thousands of existing contributions, and hundreds of current pull requests.
Reviewing current changes is the best way for me to get oriented with the current development, and a smart approach for my new contributions.
